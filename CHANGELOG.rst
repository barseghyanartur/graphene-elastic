`Sequence based identifiers
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Sequence-based_identifiers>`_
are used for versioning (schema follows below):

    major.minor[.revision]

- It's always safe to upgrade within the same minor version (for example, from
  0.3 to 0.3.4).
- Minor version changes might be backwards incompatible. Read the
  release notes carefully before upgrading (for example, when upgrading from
  0.3.4 to 0.4).
- All backwards incompatible changes are mentioned in this document.

    Alternatively, you can use ``opensearch-py`` and ``opensearch-dsl``.
    You would then need to install the ``opensearch-py`` and ``opensearch-dsl``

.. note::

    Release dedicated to John Lennon. Happy birthday, dear John!

.. note::

    This release introduces minor backwards incompatibility for ``range``,
    ``gt``, ``gte``, ``lt`` and ``lte`` filters. You should update your code.

- The ``range``, ``gt``, ``gte``, ``lt`` and ``lte`` filters are now complex
  input types. This makes it possible to use the following types in comparison:
  ``decimal.Decimal``, ``float``, ``int``, ``datetime.datetime`` and
  ``datetime.date``.

Sample new GraphQL query:

.. code-block:: javascript

    query {
      allPostDocuments(postFilter:{numViews:{gt:{decimal:"100.00"}}}) {
        edges {
          node {
            category
            title
            content
            numViews
          }
        }
      }
    }

Sample old GraphQL query:

.. code-block:: javascript

    query {
      allPostDocuments(postFilter:{numViews:{gt:"100.00"}}) {
        edges {
          node {
            category
            title
            content
            numViews
          }
        }
